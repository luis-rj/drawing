						text 500x450 {Just few notes for current version: To draw simple figures click on canvas and drag. To draw "poly-" figures (polyline and polygon) click and drag first line, then release and click and drag again to add lines. For manipulations (inserts separate `translate`, `scale`, `skew` and `rotate`) and transformations (inserts single `transform`) click and drag:
						
* for rotation, click sets the rotation center, drag creates "lever" (preferably drag initially away from center in 0 direction, i.e to right) to rotate the figure
* for scaling, click sets the start of scaling, drag scales in relation to 0x0 coordinates (I will implement "local" scaling, i.e. in relation to coordinates set by click)
* for skewing, again, click sets start, drag skews in relation to 0x0 (intend to implement "local" skewing)
* for translation, click sets start, drag translates.

Holding down control-key while drawing, switches on `ortho` mode, resulting in orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) lines. (As an interesting effect, if you hold control-key down while starting new line *after drawing an orthogonal line* the new line is drawn from starting  point orthogonally to the last line. To avoid this, start line in normal mode and press `control` only after starting. I have not decided yet whether to consider this as a bug or as a feature.)

Sift-key controls the grid-mode. If "Grid" is not checked, holding down `shift` switches grid-mode temporarily on, if it is checked, `shift` switches it temporarily off. Grid steps can be changed on edit-panel. (In second field, grid for angles is set (arc degrees to step)).

Wheel-rotation zooms in and out. New figures are inserted correctly under cursor in zoomed views.

Pictures are inserted either from web (paste url into field) or from local file-system. First click after "OK" on file-selection window sets the top-left position for the picture, second click inserts picture - or - click and drag inserts picture to dragged dimensions. (Some bug, which I haven't succeeded to weed out, requires two mouse presses, instead of one. Working on this.)
} text 500x200 {
Wheel rotation above figures-list on right now moves the selected figure up or down in z-order.

Local formatting for figures can be now selected from contextual menu on figures-list. E.G. to change pen color, select `Format->Pen->Color` and then select color from left side pen-color-picker.

Draw-block can be seen/copied/edited by clicking "Draw" on upper menu.

To play with animations, you have to:

* first insert transformation(not manipulation!) for the figure, i.e. select figure and from menu select transformation and then click on canvas to set it,
* then add animation descriptions to the "Animation" tab (print figure name, slash, number of <transformed attribute>, i.e number according to transformation syntax (can also use this: 

`set [r-center angle scale-x scale-y translate][2 3 4 5 6]` ... `square1/:angle: tick` 

to change angle, `tick` is preset reserved word counting time ticks,
* click "Animate" button on "Drawing" tab
